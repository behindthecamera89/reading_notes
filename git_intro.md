# Intro to Git
## what is Git?

- Git basically allows us to work on a repository offline, make changes to it and update the repository while having a log of changes and ways to backdate to older versions if needed. Git also allows multiple people to work on code toghether. 

# Some notes for updating Git via Terminal

# Commands to know

- git add . - 'checks to see what was changed in VS'
- git status - 'confirms what was changed and shows you'
- git commint -m "write changes made here"- 'Lets you comment on what changes you made'
