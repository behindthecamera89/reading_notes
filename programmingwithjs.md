# Programming with JS
- 'use script' should be 1st line of code for most js files
- What is a script? It is a series of instructions, that the computer can follow one by one
- creating a script is like writing a manual or a recipe
- Define the goal? Design the script? Code each step!
- Just like learing any new language, you need to understand   
    - the vocabulary - (the words that the computer understands)
    - Syntax (How you put those words togetjer to create instructions a computer can follow)
- We need to know how a computer achieves its goals, by using a programattic approac to problem-solving
- We need to learn to think like a computer
- when writing a script, deatil your goals and what you want it to achieve 
- each time a script runs, it might only use a subset of all instructions

# Expressions 
- var color = 'beige' "a value has been assigned to the variable, in this case it is Beige"
- Undefined is a data type like a number, string, boolean
- Expressions can also use 2 or more values. such as 'var area = 3 * 2

## Types of Operators
- Assignment operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- String operators 
- Comparison Operators
- Logical Operators 

# What is a Function?
- A function lets you group a series of statements toghether to perform a specific task
- Mkae this "DRY" do not repeat youself
- It allows you to reuse code over and over
- "Invoke" the function
- goodMovie(); - this invokes the function  
- WHat happens in the function stays in the function
